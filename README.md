# Crimes of Perception: A VR Sci-Fi Crime Gallery

**Crimes of Perception** is a genre-defying, immersive storytelling project hosted in a surreal, space-themed virtual art gallery built with **Spatial.io**. Each case unfolds in its own room — an unsolved sci-fi crime told through **dual perspectives**: the analytical clarity of a **detective**, and the distorted, unreliable narration of the **criminal**, delivered in first-person VR.

The viewer doesn’t just observe — they step inside the mind of the suspect.

## 🌌 Project Overview

- 🎭 **Narrative Innovation**: Dual POV storytelling gives each case a multi-dimensional feel — rational vs irrational, observer vs participant.
- 🧠 **Creative-Led Architecture**: This project prioritizes narrative architecture and immersive experience over traditional code stacks.
- 🤖 **Smart Automation with Zapier AI**: I leveraged Zapier’s AI automation to create a seamless backend pipeline — connecting dynamic inputs, triggering Webflow actions, and managing content flow without friction.
- ☁️ **Real-Time Cloud Sync**: Implemented event-driven file handling to automatically sync new case files and assets to Google Drive using webhook-based flows and Drive API triggers.
- 🌐 **Wix + Web Embeds**: Chose Wix for quick, reliable hosting and used custom embed zones to reflect live VR gallery content.
